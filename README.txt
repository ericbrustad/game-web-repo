  - Direct links: `pages/index.jsx`, `components/AssignedMediaTab.jsx`, `components/MediaPool.jsx`
  - Notes: Adds a live blob preview for cover uploads with a 1 MB guardrail, keeps the banner free of cover art, and moves media usage summaries into Assigned Media while the Media Pool now focuses on thumbnails.
- 2025-10-15 — Disable game deploys and repair image uploads. Commit: e5c57eed043e6dbd4191e93ab4db801b7871ae36.
  - Direct link: `pages/index.jsx`
  - Notes: Added a Save & Publish deploy toggle that defaults off to block unintended game pushes, hardened drag & drop cover uploads so PNG/JPG art under 1 MB lands in `/media/covers` and syncs into the Media Pool, and refreshed upload handling to accept more image types without corruption.
- 2025-10-15 — Removed the config.json quick link from the Admin Control Deck header per QA feedback. Commit: f89ac490b7ce147abe929c38e53b8c1fb470db05.

- 2025-10-15 — Banner terminology refresh & assigned media usage counters. Commit: 0ee8fe81a2c7c96dee0eec8be60999cafbe94774.
  - Direct links: `pages/index.jsx`, `components/AssignedMediaTab.jsx`, `components/MediaPool.jsx`
  - Notes: Renamed the game settings cover UX to a banner workflow with centered title + dual previews in the admin header, duplicated the banner preview as a Cover thumbnail beside the read-only heading, shifted media counts into Assigned Media with tag-aligned listings, and preserved the Game folder and password protection toggles in their off states.
- 2025-10-14 — Save & Publish polish + mission/media crash fix. Commit: 9070d1e1f29cd810a96624809cc1d449a2f352bf.
  - Direct link: `pages/index.jsx`

  - Direct links: `components/AssignedMediaTab.jsx`, `components/MediaPool.jsx`, `pages/index.jsx`
  - Notes: Surfaced media tags within the Assigned Media tab (for icons, devices, rewards, and penalties), hardened tag lookups to eliminate the browser error in the assigned media view, and moved the mission title input into the overlay header while keeping the mission ID read-only next to Save & Close.
- 2025-10-14 — Assigned media theming + usage counters polish. Commit: 106ba00d859442d0b4e9add2dd76b53ef16121ab.
  - Direct links: `components/AssignedMediaTab.jsx`, `components/MediaPool.jsx`
  - Notes: Swapped the assigned-media overview and media pool cards to rely on global appearance variables, added per-section item/use totals, and ensured media previews only render when a file is actually in use (with safety guards on the Open action).

## Yarn workspace workflow

- **Node runtime** — Vercel requires `node 22.x`; mirror that version locally and in CI before running the Yarn commands below.
- **Install dependencies** — Run `yarn install` from the repository root. In proxy-restricted environments this may surface `40
  3` responses; capture those logs so networking teams can allow the registry or provide an approved mirror. Until a Yarn lockfi
  le can be generated those failures will block `yarn build`; rely on the workspace Next.js binaries (for example `node apps/gam
  e-web/node_modules/.bin/next build`) for smoke checks and keep the proxy errors attached for follow-up.
- **Primary build** — `yarn build` now runs the admin workspace first (`yarn workspace esx-admin-control-panel-map run build`) and then the game workspace (`yarn workspace game-web run build`) so both `.next` directories exist for deployment. When the missing lockfile blocks Yarn, run `node apps/game-web/node_modules/.bin/next build` and `node apps/admin/node_modules/.bin/next build`, then attach the Yarn error output for continuity.
- **Admin build** — Use `yarn build:admin` when you need to compile the admin panel (`apps/admin`).
- **Game build** — Use `yarn build:game` for a focused game workspace rebuild.
- **Turbo aggregate** — `yarn build:turbo` retains the original `turbo run build` orchestration for multi-app rebuilds when you need every workspace’s pipeline.
- Keep `.yarnrc.yml`'s `nodeLinker: node-modules` setting in sync with production expectations so Yarn respects the existing `no
  de_modules` layout during offline work.
- Document Yarn/Corepack proxy incidents (including telemetry warnings and Corepack's Yarn 4 bootstrap) in the Settings log so 
  future operators understand the mitigation path.

## Offline pnpm workflow

- **Primary build** — `npm run build` now calls `node tools/offline-pnpm.mjs --filter game-web build`, ensuring the proxy never
  interferes with pnpm downloads. The shim executes the existing Next.js binaries from `node_modules/.bin` and mirrors pnpm's
  `--filter` semantics for the `game-web` workspace.
- **Standard checkups** — `npm run build:standard` still runs `pnpm --filter game-web build` so operators can purposely exercise
  the Corepack path when debugging the proxy tunnel. Expect it to fail in restricted environments; keep the logs for reference.
- **Turbo aggregate** — `npm run build:turbo` retains the original `turbo run build` orchestration should you need to build both
  apps locally without the shim.
- Ensure dependencies are installed locally (`npm install` or mirror the existing `node_modules`) so the offline shim can locate
  `next` inside `node_modules/.bin`.
- Update `tools/offline-pnpm.mjs` whenever workspace commands change so the shim continues to track Next.js entry points without
  touching Corepack.

Files included (drop into your Next.js project or use as reference):

/components
  - DevicesList.jsx            // Updated device list with up/down, full-row select, thumbnail, inline editor with Trigger ticker & target dropdown
  - InlineMissionResponses.jsx // Updated mission response editor with "Mark as Trigger" switch and preview badge
  - MissionListItem.jsx        // Small mission list item that displays response marker and thumbnail

AppDemo.jsx                   // Simple demo usage of components (not part of your app; for reference)

How to use:
- Copy files into your project's components/ folder.
- Import DevicesList where you render the Device sidebar.
  Example: import DevicesList from '../components/DevicesList'
- Import InlineMissionResponses where you manage mission editor responses.
  Example: import InlineMissionResponses from '../components/InlineMissionResponses'

Notes:
- The components are intentionally self-contained and use inline styles for easy drop-in.
- They expect the parent to handle persistence (saving to missions.json/config).
- The 'Trigger Target' dropdown uses a `triggerDevices` prop; if empty it shows 'None available'.
- The DevicesList inline editor provides a 'Triggered Device (ticker)' input per your request.

If you want, I can:
- Integrate these components into your actual pages/index.jsx and wire up your existing state/handlers.
- Convert styles to your project's theme or CSS modules.
- Add accessible keyboard support for reordering and selection.

## Supabase Lookup Cheatsheet

- **Games & Configs**
  - Slugs are generated automatically as `<title-slug>-<seed>` (example: `escape-ride-a1b2c3`) and stored in `games.slug` plus each `config.game.slug` payload.
  - Mission IDs auto-increment from `m01`, `m02`, … while device IDs start at `d01`, `d02`, … so Supabase JSON lookups stay predictable.
  - Publishing protection uses `config.game.deployEnabled`. When `true`, the admin shows “🟢 Protected” and blocks edits; when `false`, the admin shows “🔴 Editing unlocked”.

- **Media Pool (Supabase Storage `media` bucket)**
  - Objects save under `mediapool/<Category>/...` with tags noting the type (e.g., `image`, `audio`), folder (`folder:mediapool-images-icons`), and a `slug:<type>-<folder>-<filename>` identifier.
  - API responses surface `supabase.bucket` and `supabase.path` so deletions and mission/device bindings can recall the exact asset.
  - Dashboard deletions remove the Supabase object (when available) and prune the manifest entry so Assigned Media updates immediately.

- **Editors & Assigned Media**
  - Media Pool cards show the slug plus up to six tags for quick verification (icons vs. covers vs. mission pins, etc.).
  - The upload destination dropdown feeds the folder-derived tagging logic—choose the closest match (Images → Icons, Audio, Video, etc.) for accurate slugging.
